story/objectives/stuff that happens:
some nomad forces start a mutiny and try to join the aeon
this can have catastrophic consequences as the coordinates of the nomad home world could be compromised
some still loyal scientists and officiers manage to sabotage the hyper space generator of the main ship that is on its way to the aeon
dissidents build a base on the nearby planet to repair the damage, the loyal nomads try to sabotage their efforts by starting small attacks from a mining base and setting up an emergency signal
this delay allows you to catch up and eliminate these traitors
meanwhile, blacksun has been fired and unnormal quantum signals are detected
later in the mission the seraphim show up

characters:
second in command
chief engineer
aeon commander
nomad commander
nomad scientist
seraphim (distorted)

detailed mission plan:
map type: Theta biome

Objective 1:
secure the landing area and contact the scientists that are broadcasting the emergency signal
secondary 1:
prepare defences in the strategic locations to defend against the brainwashed nomad forces (repair them, when repaired they become operational)

#map expands after 5/8/12 minutes

Objective 2:
defend the loyal nomad outpost against the attacking nomad forces from the 3 supply bases
secondary 2:
evacuate the leading scientists (civil truck, controlable with a move ping like the megabot of brackman)
evacuating them allows the nomad fleet to use a nearby asteroid field to cause some meteor shower on the nearest sera base in the last part of the mission

#shortly before the last nomad supply base is destroyed, the jamming field in the loyal nomad colony is destroyed and they call for help

Objective 3:
destroy the 2 nomad outposts and the nomad main base and execute the traitors

#when the base is 50% destroyed (nomad acu is somewhere in the back), the seraphim arrive

Objective 4:
destroy the seraphim quantum gates
(lots of sera units are regularly dropped in drop zones and there are some larger bases near quantum gates which spawn units)

secondary 4:
decide to evacuate the nomad acu (bring it to your base where it gets picked up with a t2 transport) or to destroy it (it evacuates to a fortified position in the corner of the map)

#when the quantum gates are destroyed t4 sera bombers show up and you decide to take off and better leave fast (outro)
