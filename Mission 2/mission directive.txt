---- Nomads Mission 2 V0.1 (WIP)
--- Story
The information gathered when capturing the tech center allowed us to obtain a UEF assault plan on a planet in a neighboring system. 
You are send there to investigate and make contact with the local forces as they are potential allies.

Meanwhile the scientists managed to develop a prototype of a ground based command unit to overcome latency problems that occur when controlling units from space. (basic acu, no upgrades)

At the time of your arrival, the cybran colony is already under attack by UEF forces. 
However, they seem to be using large scale radar jamming and thus you can approach undetected. 
A first attempt to establish radio contact with the Cybran fails (same problems as with the UEF in mission 1) but after a short while, the cybran contacts you. 
(he managed to adapt his technology to be compatible).

NB: the Cybran commander is the same as in mission 5
