---- Nomads Mission 2 V0.1 (WIP)
--- Story
The information gathered when capturing the tech center allowed us to obtain a UEF assault plan on a planet in a neighboring system. 
You are send there to investigate and make contact with the local forces as they are potential allies.

Meanwhile the scientists managed to develop a prototype of a ground based command unit to overcome latency problems that occur when controlling units from space. (basic acu, no upgrades)

At the time of your arrival, the cybran colony is already under attack by UEF forces. 
However, they seem to be using large scale radar jamming and thus you can approach undetected. 
A first attempt to establish radio contact with the Cybran fails (same problems as with the UEF in mission 1) but after a short while, the cybran contacts you. 
(he managed to adapt his technology to be compatible).

NB: the Cybran commander is the same as in mission 5

--- General
Tech Level: Full T1, Partial T2 (start with T2 eco and unlock more units after objectives are complete), transports are not available for most parts of the mission

-- Map
Map Biome: Theta biome
Map size: 20x20
Starting Wrecks: 
Props: Low

--- Primary Objectives
--Part 1
- establish contact with the unknown army that is under UEF attack

--Part 2
- destroy a supply base of the UEF that is sending civilian trucks with supplies to the main UEF base (each truck will give a ressource bonus to the uef base, i.e. natural producer of mass, destroy them fast)

--Part 3
- destroy UEF battleship reinforcement
- destroy UEF commander

--- Secondary Objectives
--Part 1
- combat test for the acu (kill 50 units to unlock the gun upgrade)
- engineering test for the acu (build 20 buildings to unlock the t2 upgrade)
- speed test? (gotta go fast!)
- destroy power grid in UEF base to slow down production

--Part 2
- fixed drop of units to kill the uef base on the plateu (a support nomad entity drops a fixed set of units after the cybran temporarily disables the aa def on the mountain on the left). reward: 3 mex spots on the hill + good firing solution on uef outpost

--Part 3
- Kill AA radar to allow cybran commader to drop units (these units are dropped behind the large UEF base and target important stuff there)
